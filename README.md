## Papers
[Text-to-3D using Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16585)

Authors: Zilong Chen, Feng Wang, Huaping Liu
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for generating high-quality 3D objects using Gaussian Splatting based text-to-3D generation (GSGEN). This approach addresses the shortcomings of previous methods by exploiting the explicit nature of 3D Gaussian Splatting for better geometry and fidelity.

[DreamGaussian: Generative Gaussian Splatting for Efficient 3D Content Creation](https://dreamgaussian.github.io/)
Authors: Jiaxiang Tang, Jiawei Ren, Hang Zhou, Ziwei Liu, Gang Zeng
Abstract: DreamGaussian proposes a novel 3D content generation framework which leverages a generative 3D Gaussian Splatting model for efficient and quality 3D content creation.


[3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04079)
Authors: Bernhard Kerbl, Georgios Kopanas, Thomas Leimk√ºhler, George Drettakis
Abstract: This paper explores the use of 3D Gaussian Splatting for real-time rendering of radiance fields, revolutionizing novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos or videos.
